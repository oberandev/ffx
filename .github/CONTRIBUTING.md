3. Clone the repo and run the following:

```sh
cp .envrc.example .envrc
direnv allow
pnpm install
```

### Test

Run vitest on the affected projects

```sh
pnpm nx affected -t tests
```

### Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets are defined in the `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).
